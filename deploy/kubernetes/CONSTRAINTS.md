# Deployment Constraints

These constraints govern all deployments and experiments in this repository.

1. **Namespace**: Use **only** the `sock-shop` namespace for all deployments and experiments. No resources should be deployed to any other namespace.

2. **Change Scope**: Do not modify anything beyond what is explicitly requested. Any additional changes must receive explicit approval before being made.
